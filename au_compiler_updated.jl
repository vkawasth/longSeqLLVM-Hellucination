# au_compiler.jl  —  The AU-Fukaya LLVM Compiler
#
# Translates the abstract Fukaya category (IR) into flat, debuggable,
# SLA-compliant artifacts (machine code):
#
#   INPUT  (Fukaya IR):
#     - Lagrangian submanifolds L_i  (demographic profiles)
#     - Symplectic form ω(s,h,m)     (transit energy tensor)
#     - Product affinity closures    (AU attic objects)
#     - A∞ operations m₁, m₂, m₃
#
#   OUTPUT (compiled artifacts):
#     1. product_embeddings.parquet  — D-dim vector per product (HNSW-ready)
#     2. routing_table.parquet       — top-50 ranked products per (s,h,m) slot
#     3. stability_table.parquet     — m₃ precomputed per (s,h,m)
#     4. neighborhood_table.parquet  — k-hop subgraph per station (m₁ local)
#     5. schema.json                 — debug manifest (field names, ranges)
#
#   RUNTIME path (SLA-compliant, <5ms):
#     slot opens → routing_table lookup → serve p1
#                → inventory check     → serve p2 if needed
#                → stability check     → skip to first stable option
#                → feedback check      → skip pulled products
#
# The LLVM analogy:
#   Fukaya category  = LLVM IR    (human-readable, mathematically clean)
#   AU compiler      = LLVM opt   (optimises and flattens)
#   Routing tables   = machine code (fast, debuggable, A/B testable)
#
# Data scientists work in IR. Engineers debug machine code.
# Neither needs to touch the other's layer.

Record observed feedback by projecting onto the Lagrangian basis.

Instead of storing at key (station_idx, product_idx) — O(|S|×|P|) —
project the feedback signal onto the D demographic dimensions using
the product's embedding vector from Pass 1:

  feedback[(s, d)] += α × F_obs × embed(product)[d]

This keeps the feedback state at O(|S| × D) = 256 GB,
matching the rest of the architecture's memory footprint.

Algebraic meaning: updates the Floer cohomology class H*(CF*(L_d, T_s))
for each demographic dimension d, weighted by how much the product
activates that dimension.

Run the Seidel backward process for one (station, product, month) slot.

The backward process starts at time T (= T_horizon hours from now)

accumulating the Feynman-Kac weight:

  w(path) = exp( Σ_{t=0}^{T} V(X_t) · Δt )
